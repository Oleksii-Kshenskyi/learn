# Learning New Things!

This is a repository for me to learn new programming languages and technologies.
A repository for learning, trying out new stuff, experimenting and having fun.

This is a no-strings-attached repository. Usually each of my personal projects has a project board, GitHub issues, a lot of planning going into it, tracking time for implementing each issue, etc. That is, a lot of formalities. This repository is completely free of any kind of formalities. I don't even put much thought into commit messages here, even though usually even if the project is not really formal I would still sneak in extremely detailed and well structured commit messages when I push to it. Not here.

This is completely freeform and devoid of any logic and/or structure. Fun! :D
